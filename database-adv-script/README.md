# SQL Join Queries - ALX Airbnb Database

This project demonstrates the use of different types of SQL joins in the context of an Airbnb-like database.

## Files

- **joins_queries.sql**: Contains three join queries:
  - `INNER JOIN`: Bookings with Users
  - `LEFT JOIN`: Properties with Reviews
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Users and Bookings (with MySQL workaround)

## Objectives

- Understand and apply INNER JOIN to retrieve related records.
- Use LEFT JOIN to include unmatched records on the left table.
- Use FULL OUTER JOIN (or emulate it in MySQL) to retrieve all data from both joined tables.

## Usage

Run the SQL queries in a MySQL or PostgreSQL-compatible SQL client. Modify table or column names if your schema differs.
